You are modifying an existing full React + TypeScript + Tailwind SPA named Hind General Store.
You will fix bugs, add missing logic, improve security, and extend features without breaking any existing features.

Below is the complete app structure and all files (package.json, index.html, index.tsx, App.tsx, store, types, constants, components, admin files, etc.).
Use these files as the base — DO NOT delete or rewrite the whole app.
You must only fix, improve, and add missing logic.

📌 MAIN GOALS (VERY IMPORTANT — FOLLOW EXACTLY)
✔ 1. Fix all hidden bugs & TypeScript errors

Make the entire application stable, remove white-screen issues, incorrect imports, missing props, runtime crashes, undefined map errors, and hydration issues.

✔ 2. Add full Admin Order Editing workflow

Admin must be able to:

Edit order items

Change quantity

Remove / replace items

Add reason for editing (required)

Update total automatically

Save edited order

Store edit history inside order.internalNotes

Trigger notification for user

✔ 3. Improve Payment Info system

Inside admin dashboard:

Admin can edit UPI ID, QR code, bank details

Admin can add “Name for UPI verification”

User sees "Verified Name" automatically when selecting UPI mode

Add validation to avoid wrong UPI or bank format

✔ 4. Add Backup & Restore (safe, non-corrupt)

Inside admin:

Export all localStorage app data as a JSON file

Import JSON file to restore full app state

Validate JSON before restoring to prevent corruption

✔ 5. Add Profit Tracking (Graph + Table)

Add a new menu in admin:

Profit Overview

Daily / Weekly / Monthly graphs (use chart.js or lightweight alternative)

Show:

Total sales

Total expenses

Total profit

Popular products

Loss items

Style must be clean & wide to understand clearly.

✔ 6. Add Customer Warranty System

For purchased items in an order:

Admin can set warranty period (days/months)

User can view warranty status in order history

Warranty claim feature (user submits ticket)

✔ 7. Add Customer Khata (Credit System)

Add logic in user model + admin panel:

Admin enables/disables credit

Admin sets credit limit

Admin sets due date

App must show warning when due date passed

Order placement should check:

If user has khata enabled

If the new order exceeds credit limit

✔ 8. Security Fixes

Because this app uses LocalStorage, add:

Simple hashing for passwords (non-reversible)

Mask sensitive fields in UI

Validate all form inputs

Sanitize text fields

Fix UPI, IFSC, mobile validations

Prevent XSS and unescaped HTML

✔ 9. Fix Admin Dashboard

Right now, AdminDashboardView is missing many required props & causes blank screens.
Fix all missing props and complete the admin functionality.
